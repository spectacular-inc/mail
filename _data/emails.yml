        Estella, where on earth did you put my badge? I can't find it
        anywhere and suspect this was one of your and Devin's pranks
        on your poor product manager.

        safekeeping! The code is 5924. Is that OK??? Sorry!!!

        Hey! Congrats on the great ad campaign! I see you put up your
        ads and their impact on the board. Last time I checked our
        stock value was at 400. With the new ads, what are we at now?

        I’ve been reading about this new science about energy and harmony
        and our labs layout is a recipe for disaster. The way the entrances
        are placed is bad energy and we should get rid of them in favor of
        one on the east side so we enter facing the direction of success and
        luck so our projects go well.

        Hey Estella, Turns out the color sensor on the training robot
        was busted so I’ve put it in storage for now and we can
        talk later to figure out a replacement. It didn’t sense
        markers that were similar color of the gridlines on the course,
        resulting in buggy readings. Hope this didn’t cause any issues!

        Hey Mario, I locked my badge in my cabinet and I can’t get it out.
        I don’t need that one deactivated because I’m sure I’ll figure it
        out, can you just get me another one that I can use in the meantime?

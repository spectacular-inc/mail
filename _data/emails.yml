        Estella, where on earth did you put my badge? I can't find it
        anywhere and suspect this was one of your and Devin's pranks
        on your poor product manager.

        OMG no it wasn't, Priya! I just locked it in a computer bag for
        safekeeping! The code is 5924. Is that OK??? Sorry!!!

        Hey! Congrats on the pet targeted ad campaign! I see you put up your
        ad up on the board. Last time I checked our
        stock value was at 400. For each of the different species, our stock went up by 200! 
        Great insight to diversify the pet options available.
        With the new ads, what are we at now?

        I’ve been reading about this new science about energy and harmony
        and our lab's layout is a recipe for disaster. The door placement
        is bad energy and we should tear it all down and add new ones. We
        should start ALL PATHS facing WEST to ensure success in life.

        Hey Estella, Turns out the color sensor on the training robot
        was busted so I’ve put it in storage for now and we can
        talk later to figure out a replacement. It didn’t sense
        markers that were same color of the gridlines on the course,
        resulting in buggy readings. Hope this didn’t cause any issues!

        Hey Mario, I locked my badge in my cabinet and I can’t get it out.
        I don’t need that one deactivated because I’m sure I’ll figure it
        out, can you just get me another one that I can use in the meantime?

        Estella, where on earth did you put my badge?! I swear I put it
        in my backpack but I can't find it anywhere.

        I swear I have didn't do anything, Priya! You told me to keep your
        backpack safe when that robot tour group came so I used that lock
        on your desk to secure it!

        I'm so, so sorry to make you mad at me! I just wanted to help!

        Oh, it's on my desk! I just remember I accidentally wrote
        the code down backwards!

        Heyo Priya, what do you think of these new designs for
        the next version of the Sonia Specs? They look pretty
        sick, if you ask me.

        Looks fine to me, but I worry the nose bridge is a little too wide
        for kids to wear them comfortably.

        (Although should we really be selling to kids? I guess, if they
        want these glasses so badly...)
